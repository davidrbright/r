#### Introduction

# starts with plotting. plot(child ~ parent, galton), plot(y ~ x, dataset)

# there was a function used called jitter that plotted each of the ones covering each other more darkly
# it added more blackness the more points were on it.

# basic regression line regrLine <- lm(y, ~ x, dataset)

# I added the regression line to the plot with abline(regrLine, lwd=3, col='red') I don't know the last parts of the function totally

# to get the summary information of the regression type summary(regrLine)
